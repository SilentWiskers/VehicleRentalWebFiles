# VehicleRentalWebFiles
This repository contains web files for a vehicle rental website. This project allows a user to create an account and reserve vehicle rentals. Vehicles contain a price per day to rent and become unavailable to rent until returned. Customers can select a vehicle and how many days they wish to rent the vehicle. An admin account exists to manage the website, accounts, and vehicles.
